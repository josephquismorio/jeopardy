# jeopardy
A quick trivia program that takes questions from a dataset containing 150,000+ Jeopardy questions. 

*This is a simple predecessor to a larger project I'm working on - essentially a "pseudocoded" version of what I'm looking to build. Updates soon.*

The .tsv file containing all questions can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EECRP29IhRinwaeU_sR-QuB2Z3g-7gR6/view?usp=sharing).
